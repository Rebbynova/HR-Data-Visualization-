## Introduction
In todayâ€™s business environment, understanding workforce trends is essential for strategic decision-making. This project focuses on analyzing HR data to uncover patterns and insights that can inform employee retention strategies. By utilizing data visualization tools like Power BI, I aimed to identify key factors contributing to employee attrition, along with patterns based on department, educational background, and gender.

This analysis not only highlights critical workforce dynamics but also offers actionable recommendations for improving employee satisfaction and retention. With skills in data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, I structured this project to demonstrate my ability to manage and interpret HR data effectively, providing clear insights that can support organizational growth.

## Data Overview
The HR dataset was downloaded as a CSV file. It includes various employee details such as business travel, age band, department, gender, educational field, job role, attrition, marital status, and more.

## Steps for HR Data Visualization
1. Data Download: Sourced data as a CSV file.
2. Data Cleaning: Performed data cleaning to prepare the dataset for analysis.
3. Data Transformation:
-  **Changed data types**
-  **Promoted headers**
-  **Added conditional columns**
-  **Renamed columns as needed**

## Key Calculations

1. Total Number of Current Employees = (Total Employees - Attrition Count)
2. Attrition Rate = (Sum of Attrition Count / Sum of Total Employees)

## Definition of Attrition

Attrition refers to a gradual reduction in the workforce due to factors like resignations, retirements, or other reasons. In a business context, attrition is often measured as a percentage and serves as an indicator of workforce stability.

## HR Visualizations

1. Employee Count: Displayed using a card visual to show the total number of employees.
2. Attrition Rate: Calculated as 16% using a custom measure.
3. Charts Used:
- **Doughnut Chart**: Shows attrition count by department.
- **Bar Chart**: Visualizes attrition by educational field.
- **Pie Chart**: Displays attrition by gender.
## Insights from HR Data

1. Departmental Attrition:
- **R&D Department has the highest attrition count (133, or 56.12%)**.
- **HR Department has the lowest attrition count (12, or 38.06%)**.
2. Attrition by Educational Field:
- **The Life Sciences field has the highest attrition count (89), followed by the Medical field (63)**.
- **Human Resources has the lowest attrition count (7). This may be due to the constant professional development demands in Life Sciences and Medical fields**.
3. Gender-Based Attrition:
- **Male employees have a higher attrition count (150, or 63.29%) compared to female employees (87, or 36.71%)**.

## Recommendations
To improve employee retention, the company should develop a career advancement plan for its employees. This initiative would provide growth opportunities within their fields, enhancing employee satisfaction and retention.
